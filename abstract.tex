In this paper we explored the validity of drag and lift formulas on 
paper airplanes. We constructed paper airplanes of different sizes and geometries 
and calculated their theoretical drag and lift. We then performed experiments to determine the time of flight in order to compare them to theoretical results.
Lastly we conducted experiments to determine the stability of the paper airplanes as a function 
of position of center of gravity and wing geometry.
