In this paper we will explore the validity of drag and lift formulas on 
paper airplanes. We will construct airplanes of different sizes and geometries 
and calculate their theoretical drag and lift. We will perform experiments to
determine time of flight in order to compare them to our theoretical results.
Lastly we will also perform experiments to determine the stability of the airplane.
