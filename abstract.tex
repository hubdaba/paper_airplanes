In this paper we explored the validity of drag and lift formulas on 
paper airplanes. We constructed paper airplanes of different sizes and geometries. 
We then performed experiments to determine the time of flight in order to try to qualitatively 
test theories about the drag, lift, and stability of paper airplanes.
In the experiments, we found that moving the center of gravity towards the nose of the plane
increases the stability of the plane. We also found that there is a positive correlation between
the aspect ratio and the lift coefficient. In conclusion we found that the theories accomponaying
traditional aerodynamics also apply to paper airplane flight.
