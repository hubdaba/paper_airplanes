\section{Results and Analysis}

\subsection{The Arrow}

To perform the experiments, we constructed ``The Arrow" paper airplanes using half a sheet of GP Spectrum A4 Multi-Use paper, 
which is 0.103mm thick and 4.6 gram in weight. See Figure~\ref{fig:arrow} for a picture of The Arrow. The Arrow was chosen because
of its simple and rigid structure. We spent around two minutes to fold it from scratch. Due to The Arrow's relatively 
wing aspect ratio, it experiences minimal flapping motion during flight. As a result, the actual 
flight condition better resembles what is assumed in the theory. We also applied double-sided tape in the middle section to improve its rigidity.

  \label{fig:arrow}
\end{figure}

The Arrow measures $10000$mm in length and $100000$mm in width, and has a narrow delta wing shape. See Figure~\ref{fig:arrowdimension} for the detailed
dimension measurements. All launches were conducted
manually and an iPhone application was developed to record the launching speed.

\subsection{Stability vs Center of Gravity}
We attached a metal clip $100$g in weight to various positions in the middle section of The Arrow to shift its center 
of gravity (see Figure~\ref{fig:clip}).

\begin{figure}[hl]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/clip.png}
		\caption{We attached a clip of $100$g in weight to various positions of the paper airplane to shift its center of gravity.}
	\label{fig:clip}
\end{figure}

Since the metal clip was significantly heavier than the paper airplane, we could reasonably assume the position of the clip
corresponded to the position of center of gravity. We then launched The Arrow at preset height and speed. To measure its stability, we counted the 
number of rotations the model had completed in the air and the distance it had traveled. A stable flight should have a long travel distance and minimal rotations.
Figure~\ref{fig:centerofgravity} shows the experimental result. 


\begin{figure}[hl]
	\centering
		\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{figures/centerofgravity.png}
		\caption{Flight stability v.s. the center of gravity. The flight distance and number of ratations in the air provide a qualitative measure of the flight 
		stability: the longer the distance and fewer ratations, the more stable the flight.}
	\label{fig:centerofgravity}
\end{figure}

According to section XXX, the aerodynamic center is at a quarter length from the front of the aerofoil. Center of gravity before this point gives a stable flight, and
after this point produces a turbulent flight. This is demonstrated qualitatively by Figure~\ref{fig:centerofgravity}. When the clip is moved after a 
quarter of the length from the front end, a large number of rotations occurred in all axes and the flight distance was short.


\subsection{Stability vs Wing Angles}
As discussed in section XXX, wing angle has a direct effect on flight stability. To test this, we manually adjusted the wing angle and used scotch tape
to fix the angle. We chose three angles(45, 0, -45 with respect to horizon) and launched the paper airplanes ten times at each setting. The average distance and number of rotations 
are summarized in Figure~\ref{fig:angles}. 

\begin{figure}[hl]
	\centering
		\includegraphics{figures/angles.png}
		\caption{Flight distance and stability at different wing angles.}
	\label{fig:angles}
\end{figure}

The data demonstrate that as the wing angle transitions from dihydral to anhydral, the flight becomes shorter and less stable. This supports the prediction in section XXX.
