\section{Introduction}

Paper airplanes are more than children's toys; they foster creativity and inspire elegant engineering solutions in all generations. 
Due to the simplicity in construction, thousands of paper airplane designs have been explored. For example, the Guinnes World Record 
paper airplane, "The Glider",  was capable of staying in air for an astounishing $15.4$s.  

These designs differ widely in paper material, wing geometry, 
and body shape; nevertheless, they are all governed by the same aerodynamic principles. This paper aims to investigate these principles
 on a theoretical as well as an empirical basis. More specifically, we focus on two topics: flight stability and lift vs drag relation. 
Theories are first discussed, and then experiments are performed to illustrate the principles. Due to our limited access to scientific 
equipment, most of the experiments performed are crude in nature and should be examined qualitively instead of quantitatively. We discovered
that our experimental results are consistent with previous researches and demonstrate the validity of existing aerodynamical theories.

Paper airplanes have similar Reynolds-number range as insects (see Figure~\ref{fig:reynoldsrange}). Furthermore, they have similar weight and wing thickness as
insects. As a result, the findings from this paper may be applied to the widely studied fields of insect aerodynamics. The complex fight mechanism of insects may
be modeled using an appropriately folded paper airplanes.
