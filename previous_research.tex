\section{Previous Research}

In the Nanyang Technological University, research was done about the aerodynamics of 
paper airplanes. They believed that research into paper airplane can help design
Micro Air Vehicles. They primarily focused on the dart design. Using flight speed and
distance traveled the lift and drag coefficients can be determined. They concluded that
the dart paper airplane has high lift coefficients over a large range of angle of attacks. 
We hope to emulate their experiment in our experiments.
